# Colobopsis Explodens

is a small clone of „Lemmings“, ade for Ludum Dare 43.

Due to overpopulation, some ants have to leave the ant hill and get a new one. But the road to the new anthill is dangerous there would be:

- Obstacles blocking the way
- natural enemies
- abysses
- and so on 

To sustain the existence of your own species, enough ants must survive. In order to protect and defend against the impending dangers, some ants can sacrifice themselves.

They can:
- sacrifice himself to block the way with her body
- blow up himself to destroy blocking obstacles
- blow up himself and secrete a toxic secretion to defeat enemies
